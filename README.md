## 🌟 Key Highlights

### ⚙️ Technology Stack Breakdown
Explore the **technologies** used in a scalable project and their specific contributions to achieving project goals.
- Django: Web framework powering the backend, ORM, and admin; ideal for rapid, secure API development.

- Django REST Framework (DRF) or Graphene‑Django (GraphQL): Implement REST or GraphQL endpoints for clients.

- MySQL (or PostgreSQL): Primary relational database for persistent domain data (users, properties, bookings, payments).

- Redis: Caching layer and support for rate‑limiting/sessions/queues.

- Celery + Redis/RabbitMQ: Background tasks (email receipts, cleanup jobs, availability sync).

- Docker & Docker Compose: Containerize services for consistent local and CI environments.

- GitHub Actions: CI/CD workflows for testing, building images, and deploying.

- Stripe (or Paystack/Flutterwave): Payment processing integration, webhooks for confirmations and refunds.

- NGINX / Traefik: Reverse proxy, TLS termination, static assets.

- OpenAPI / GraphQL Schema: Machine‑readable API contracts for documentation and client generation.

### 🗄️ Database Design Proficiency
Plan and document a **relational database structure** with entities, attributes, and relationships that mirror **real-world requirements**.
Create a Database Design section (below) including entities (3–5 key fields each) and relationships. Example:

#### User
- Fields: id, email (unique), password_hash, full_name, phone, role, created_at
- Notes: A user can be a guest and/or host.

#### Property
- Fields: id, host_id (FK User), title, description, address, city, country, lat, lng, nightly_price, max_guests, created_at
- Relations: A User (host) has many Properties.

#### PropertyImage
- Fields: id, property_id (FK), url, alt_text, position

#### Availability
- Fields: id, property_id (FK), date, is_available, price_override

#### Booking
- Fields: id, guest_id (FK User), property_id (FK), check_in, check_out, guests_count, status (pending, confirmed, canceled), total_amount, created_at

#### Payment
- Fields: id, booking_id (FK), provider (stripe/paystack), amount, currency, status (succeeded, refunded, failed), transaction_ref, paid_at

#### Review
- Fields: id, booking_id (FK), author_id (FK User), rating (1–5), comment, created_at

#### Relationships summary:

- A User (host) has many Properties.

- A Property has many Availability days and PropertyImages.

- A User (guest) makes many Bookings; a Booking belongs to one Property and one guest.

- A Booking has one Payment (or many for split/refund scenarios).

- A Review belongs to a Booking and is authored by a User.

### 🚀 Feature-Driven Development
Identify and describe **core features** of the application, focusing on their relevance to the **user experience** and **business logic**.
Create a Feature Breakdown section (below) including:

- User Management: Sign up/sign in, profile management, host onboarding; essential for identity, personalization, and permissions.

- Property Management: Hosts create/update listings, upload images, set pricing/availability; drives supply and discoverability.

- Search & Discovery: Filter by location, date, price, amenities; improves conversion by surfacing relevant inventory.

- Booking System: Real‑time availability checks, reservation creation, cancellation/modification with policies; core revenue flow.

- Payments & Receipts: Secure checkout, provider integration, refunds, and receipts via webhooks; ensures trust and compliance.

- Reviews & Ratings: Post‑stay feedback to build reputational signals for guests and hosts; improves marketplace quality.

- Notifications & Emails: Transactional emails (booking confirmed, payment receipts) and alerts to reduce friction.

- Admin & Moderation: Admin dashboard to manage users, listings, disputes, payouts; ensures platform integrity.

### 🔐 API Security Fundamentals
Implement and document **key security measures** to safeguard application data and ensure **secure transactions**.
#### Create an API Security section (below) describing:

- Authentication: Token‑based (JWT) or session auth; OAuth for 3rd‑party sign‑in. Protects identity and sessions.

- Authorization: Role‑based and resource‑level permissions (hosts vs guests vs admin). Ensures least privilege.

- Input Validation & Sanitization: Prevents injection/XSS; enforce schemas with DRF serializers or GraphQL input types.

- Rate Limiting & Throttling: Mitigates abuse/brute force; e.g., IP‑based throttles with Redis.

- Transport Security: Enforce HTTPS/TLS, HSTS; secure cookies.

- Secrets Management: Environment variables via GitHub Actions + encrypted secrets; never commit sec

### 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline Integration
Gain insights into setting up **automated development pipelines**, boosting efficiency and minimizing errors during deployment.

#### CI (Continuous Integration): Automatically tests, lints, and validates all code changes before merging.

#### CD (Continuous Deployment): Builds and ships the app into staging/production environments automatically.

##### Benefits

- Reduces deployment errors

- Speeds up release cycles

- Ensures only verified code goes live

- Tools Used

- GitHub Actions → Automation of tests, builds, and deployments

- Docker → Consistent environment via containerization

- Docker Compose → Multi-service management (e.g., app + database)

- Secrets/Env Variables → Secure handling of credentials

##### Workflow Summary

- Trigger: Runs on push or pull_request to main

- Build & Test: Installs dependencies and runs tests with pytest

- Docker Build & Push: Builds app image and pushes it to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
